# Retail-Sales-Data-Set-Analysis

This spreadsheet is an exercise to practice various functions and formulae, such as filtering, sum, average, max, sorting, conditional formatting, and tables. I also practiced data visualisation techniques with pivot tables and slicers.

Here, I created tables to calculate the overall sales, divided across product types and across customer gender, and I also calculated the total commission paid out to employees across both years, as well as the average commission earned per sale.

Then, on this page, I presented insights into the data using a pivot table, with slicers to allow for more focused insights dynamically.

With some additional data regarding student scores, I utilised formulae and conditional formatting to determine average as well as high scores for the students, and also make the highest average performers more visible at a glance.
